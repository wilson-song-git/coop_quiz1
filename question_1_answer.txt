My favorite editor is Atom﻿﻿. One of the many reasons that I like it the most is the clean UI. I think it is very important to be able to see all of your work clearly so that there are no confusions when you are coding. Another reason I like Atom the most is that there are so many packages to use and they are all free. For example there are packages that allow you to debug or packages that let you create HTML and CSS files quickly. There are basically packages for everything that a programmer needs including packages that cater to every single language. This means that atoms can be powerful for any project. The last reason is that Atom has embedded git version control meaning that I can easily create and push to repositories. This makes it a lot easier for me to have version control on the projects that I am doing. I've used atoms for a long time now so I am also the most comfortable using it which is a big factor I think when it comes to choosing an editor. I believe that all editors are good for their own reasons but it's up to the programmer to choose the one that they are most accustomed and comfortable with using.
